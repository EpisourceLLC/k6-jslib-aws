# k6-jslib-aws

A library allowing to interact with AWS resources for k6.io

This is an AWS client library for k6. It intends to allow interacting with a subset of AWS services in the context of k6 load test script.

## Supported features

At the moment, this library provides the following:
* `S3Client`: allows to list buckets and bucket's objects, as well as uploading, downloading, and deletion of objects.
* `V4 signature`: allows to sign requests to amazon AWS services 

## Demo

### S3

```javascript
import exec from 'k6/execution'

import {
    // listBuckets,
    AWSConfig,
    S3Client,
} from 'https://jslib.k6.io/aws/0.1.0/index.js'

const testFile = open('./bonjour.txt', 'r')

const awsConfig = new AWSConfig(
    __ENV.AWS_REGION,
    __ENV.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    __ENV.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
)

const s3 = new S3Client(awsConfig)

const testBucketName = 'test-jslib-aws'
const testFileKey = 'bonjour.txt'

export default function () {
    // List the buckets the AWS authentication configuration
    // gives us access to.
    const buckets = s3.listBuckets()

    // If our test bucket does not exist, abort the execution.
    if (buckets.filter((b) => b.name === testBucketName).length == 0) {
        exec.test.abort()
    }

    // Let's upload our test file to the bucket
    s3.putObject(testBucketName, testFileKey, testFile)

    // Let's list the test bucket objects
    const objects = s3.listObjects(testBucketName)

    // And verify it does contain our test object
    if (objects.filter((o) => o.key === testFileKey).length == 0) {
        exec.test.abort()
    }

    // Let's redownload it verify it's correct, and delete it
    const obj = s3.getObject(testBucketName, testFileKey)
    s3.deleteObject(testBucketName, testFileKey)
}

```
